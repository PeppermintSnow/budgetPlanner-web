# Budget Planner
A budget planner made with React, Bootstrap, and ~~scuffed~~ SASS.
This is my first ~~hobby~~ project; view the source code at your own riskâ€” it's one hell of a mess.

## To-do
- [ ] The UI could be made better...
- [ ] Code refactoring... Like *intense* code refactoring...
- [ ] Local Storage for saved data
- [ ] A print result button/function
- [ ] Carousel for separate lists... if possible...
